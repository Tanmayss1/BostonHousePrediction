# BostonHousePrediction


Instruction

Boston Housing Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. It has been used extensively throughout the Data Science World to benchmark algorithms.

Note:
Attention, learners. Please be aware that the Boston dataset has been eliminated from prior versions of scikit learn due to ethical considerations. If you wish to access the Boston dataset, we suggest installing an older version of scikit learn. You can accomplish this by executing the following command: "pip install scikit-learn==1.1.3."

The Data
The target of this Assignment is to be able to predict the target variable (Median house value), given the other input variables.

Column	Description
crim	per capita crime rate by town.
zn	proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
indus	proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
chas	Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
nox	nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
rm	average number of rooms per dwelling.
age	proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
dis	weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
rad	index of accessibility to radial highways.
tax	full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
ptratio	pupil-teacher ratio by town.
black	1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
lstat	lower status of the population (percent).
medv	median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. This is the target variable.

The target of this Assignment is to be able to predict the target variable (Median house value), given the other input variables.

Thoughts
Some ideas/thoughts to help you with the exercise:
What ML task is this? Classification? Regression? Clustering?
What kind of models would be best to accomplish this?
How would you maximize performance of the models that you evaluate for this task?
How much is the cost of this model? (Time and compute cost)
Which model gives the best RoI (Return on Investment)?
End Objective
Can you discover a model that performs this prediction task with a score of over 0.9?
